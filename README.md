# Network Concepts

Working through "Beej's Guide to Network Concepts" by Brian "Beej Jorgensen"
Hall. You can read it for yourself here:

## Why?

Just an educational exercise. Partly an excuse to brush up on network
programming, because devices talking to each other is cool. Mostly an excuse
to practice Python and think through some coding problems, though.

## What next?

If I can be bothered, maybe some of these:

- [ ] See if its worthwhile to make the code more "Pythonic"
- [ ] Revisit projects that had extensions (or make some!)
- [ ] Be a good software engineer and write some tests
- [ ] Be a better software engineeer and write some docs
- [ ] Be a more gooderer software engineer and organize the project into something installable
- [ ] Be the best possible software engineer and Rewrite it in Rustâ„¢
